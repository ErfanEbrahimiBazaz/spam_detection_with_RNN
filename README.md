# Spam detection by deep nets

This repo is a complementary to [my other git repo](https://github.com/ErfanEbrahimiBazaz/spam_detection_with_nltk) for spam detection.

In [my previous repo](https://github.com/ErfanEbrahimiBazaz/spam_detection_with_nltk) we constructed a TF-IDF vector and trained a naive Baise network for spam detection. In this repository we use LSTM for spam detection. Both repositories work with the same data set.

I make use of [this link](https://towardsdatascience.com/spam-detection-in-emails-de0398ea3b48) to implement the code.
